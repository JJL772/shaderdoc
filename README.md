# Shader Documentation for Strata

This repo contains automatically dumped shader documentation for Strata Source along with a script for generating markdown documents off of it.

Primarily intended to be the basis for real hand-edited documentation, aside from the defaults and single sentence descriptions provided in code, there's not much of use here.
